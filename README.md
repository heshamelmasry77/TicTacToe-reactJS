# TicTacToe-reactJS

It is a simple MERN app for a tictacToe game!
the project has the back-end and the front-end in the same app.

the front-end app which is react lives in the : react-ui folder 
the back-end in the main folder
each has a separate package.json 

To run the project:


Make sure you have these installed just run yarn install on the back end folder and then navigate to the front-end folder and also run yarn install
	- [node.js](http://nodejs.org/)
  - express.js

	


Navigate to the project then : 
* simpley Clone > git clone
* CD to the folder cd TicTacToe-reactJS
* Run > yarn install` to install the project dependencies
and then run also for the front-end yarn install to install the project dependencies


to see the project run the back end using yarn start
and the front-end using yarn serve 

you have two choices to use the app served from the back-end or the front-end 

always keeo the back-end running !! for the apis
thank you,
