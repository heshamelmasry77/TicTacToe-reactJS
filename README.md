# TicTacToe-reactJS

It is a simple MERN app for a tictacToe game!
the project has the back-end and the front-end in the same folder.

the front-end folder where react lives (react-ui)
the back-end folder where i create the server (the main folder)
each has a separate package.json as they are combined apps

To run the project:


Make sure you have these installed just run yarn install on the (back end folder main folder) and then navigate to
the front-end folder(react-ui) and also run yarn install and then yarn build
	

you have two choices to use the app served from the back-end or the front-end 

if you on the front-end folder do "yarn serve" and it will run on : http://localhost:3000/
or if you wanna serve it from the back-end folder : "yarn start" and it will run on : http://localhost:7000/

Note : it is very imp to run yarn build on the front-end folder (react-ui)


on main folder :
yarn install
TO RUN : yarn start

on front-end folder  (react-ui):
yarn install
yarn build
TO RUN : yarn serve 



always keep the back-end running !! for the apis
thank you,
