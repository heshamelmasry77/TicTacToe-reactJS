# TicTacToe-reactJS


### Try Deployed version here: https://tictacteo-hesh.herokuapp.com/

It is a simple MERN app for a tic-tac-toe game!
the project has the back-end and the front-end in the same folder.

the front-end folder where react lives (react-UI)
the back-end folder where I create the server (the main folder)
each has a separate package.json as they are combined apps

To run the project:


Make sure you have these installed just run yarn install on the (back end folder main folder) and then navigate to
the front-end folder(react-UI) and also run yarn install and then yarn build
	

you have two choices to use the app served from the back-end or the front-end 

if you on the front-end folder do "yarn serve" and it will run on http://localhost:3000/
or if you wanna serve it from the back-end folder: "yarn start" and it will run on http://localhost:7000/

Note: it is very important to run yarn build on the front-end folder (react-UI)


on the main folder :
yarn install
TO RUN: yarn start

on front-end folder  (react-UI):
yarn install
yarn build
TO RUN: yarn serve 



Please keep the back-end running !! for the APIs
thank you,

Hesh Ramsis
